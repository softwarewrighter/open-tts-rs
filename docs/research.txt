Conversation with Gemini
I am looking for a good open-model liberally licensed (for commercial use) TTS model that I can run on a consumer grade Nvidia GPU locally. I've had bad experiences with Dia, GPTsovits, and Toucan (low quality).

For a liberally licensed (Apache 2.0 / MIT), high-quality, commercial-use TTS model that runs locally on a consumer NVIDIA GPU, Kokoro is currently the strongest recommendation.

It explicitly avoids the quality issues you faced with Toucan/Dia and the licensing traps of many "open" models (like Fish Speech or standard StyleTTS2).

Top Recommendation: Kokoro
License: Apache 2.0 (Permissive for commercial use; code and model weights).

Why it fits: It is a new (~82M parameter) model released in late 2024/early 2025 that punches significantly above its weight class. It offers "near-ElevenLabs" quality for English and is incredibly fast.

Performance: extremely lightweight. On a consumer NVIDIA GPU (RTX 3060/4070), it runs faster than real-time. It is efficient enough to run alongside a local LLM without bottlenecking your VRAM.

Voice Quality: Much more natural prosody than Piper or Toucan. It handles difficult intonations well and feels less "robotic."

How to run it:

Python: pip install kokoro (official library is gaining traction).

ONNX: Fully supports ONNX, making it easy to integrate into production apps.

WebUI: Can be run via Kokoro-FastAPI or within standard text-generation-webui extensions.

Runner-Up (For Features/Zero-Shot): Chatterbox (by Resemble AI)
License: MIT.

Why it fits: If you specifically need Zero-Shot Voice Cloning (cloning a voice from a 5-second sample) while maintaining a strict MIT license, this is your best bet.

Pros: Supports real-time synthesis, multiple languages, and is built by a commercial TTS company (Resemble) releasing their research model.

Cons: Slightly heavier setup than Kokoro.

Bleeding Edge Alternative: OpenF5-TTS
License: Apache 2.0.

Why it fits: This is a "fork" of the popular F5-TTS. The original F5-TTS is excellent but uses a non-commercial license due to its training data. OpenF5-TTS was retrained from scratch on the permissive Emilia-YODAS dataset.

Use case: Use this if you need advanced flow-matching architecture (similar to Stability AI's methods) but legally cannot use the original F5 weights.

Note: As it is a retraining effort, verify the current checkpoint quality; it may slightly trail the original non-commercial F5 model.

⚠️ Models to Avoid (Traps)
Since you are looking for commercial use, be very careful with these popular models often recommended on Reddit/Twitter:

Fish Speech: AVOID. While the code is Apache 2.0, the official pre-trained weights are CC-BY-NC-SA (Non-Commercial). The authors strictly enforce this. You would have to retrain it yourself on clean data to use it commercially.

StyleTTS 2: CAUTION. The code is MIT, but the most popular pre-trained weights (trained on LibriTTS + proprietary data) are often Non-Commercial. You must specifically find a checkpoint trained only on LibriTTS (which usually sounds worse) to use it legally.

Tortoise TTS: OUTDATED. High quality but painfully slow. Kokoro beats it on speed by an order of magnitude with similar quality.

Summary Recommendation
Start with Kokoro. It is currently the "gold standard" for open-weight, commercially usable, local TTS.

GitHub: hexgrad/kokoro

HuggingFace: hexgrad/Kokoro-82M

How can I train Kokoro to use (clone) my voice, or add new voices? Is there a way to combine (average) multiple voices to derive a new voice? If not with Kokoro, then which alternatives have these cababilities? I prefer ones with liberal (commercial use permitted) licenses.

Can Kokoro Clone Voices?
Short Answer: No, not in the "upload 5 seconds and it speaks" sense (Zero-Shot Cloning). Kokoro does not currently have a native encoder to take a user's audio sample and instantly generate a voice from it.

However, it DOES support Voice Mixing (combining existing voices), which allows you to create unique, custom voices that don't sound like the stock presets.

1. How to "Create" a Voice with Kokoro (Voice Mixing)
Since Kokoro uses vector embeddings for voices, you can mathematically average them to create new ones. This is a powerful way to generate a unique "brand voice" that is legally safe and distinct from the defaults.

The Concept: You combine voice vectors using weights (e.g., 50% Bella + 50% Sarah).

How to do it:

Using Kokoro-TTS CLI: Many community tools now support a simple syntax for this.

Bash
# Example: Mix 60% Bella (American) with 40% Emma (British)
kokoro-tts --voice "af_bella:0.6,bf_emma:0.4" "Hello world"
Using Python (Programmatic): You can load the .pt voice files (which are just PyTorch tensors), average them, and save the result as a new voice file.

Python
import torch
# Load two voices
voice1 = torch.load("voices/af_bella.pt")
voice2 = torch.load("voices/af_sarah.pt")

# Create a 50/50 mix
new_voice = (voice1 * 0.5) + (voice2 * 0.5)

# Save as a new custom voice
torch.save(new_voice, "voices/my_custom_voice.pt")
2. Best Alternatives for "Real" Voice Cloning (Commercial Use)
If you need to clone your voice (or a specific target voice) from an audio sample, Kokoro is not the right tool. Use one of these liberally licensed alternatives instead:

Top Pick: OpenVoice V2
License: MIT (Code & Weights are confirmed free for commercial use).

Why it works: It is specifically designed for Zero-Shot Voice Cloning. You provide a reference audio clip, and it controls the "tone color" (timbre) of the voice while preserving the accent/style.

Pros: Very fast, MIT license is extremely permissive.

Cons: The prosody (rhythm/emotion) is sometimes less expressive than F5 or Kokoro, as it focuses heavily on tone matching.

Runner Up: OpenF5-TTS (Apache 2.0 Variant)
License: Apache 2.0.

Important Distinction: The "official" F5-TTS weights are Non-Commercial (CC-BY-NC). You must specifically use OpenF5-TTS (available on HuggingFace), which was retrained on the permissive Emilia-YODAS dataset.

Why it works: It uses "Flow Matching" (similar to Stable Diffusion for audio). It is excellent at cloning not just the voice, but the atmosphere (background noise, reverb, emotion) of the reference clip.

Pros: State-of-the-art architecture.

Cons: Heavier to run than Kokoro; check the OpenF5 specific checkpoint quality, as it may be slightly behind the official non-commercial one.

Summary Comparison Table
Feature	Kokoro (v1.0)	OpenVoice V2	OpenF5-TTS
Best For	Speed & Natural Prosody	Instant Voice Cloning	Advanced/Atmospheric Cloning
Cloning Type	Mixing Only (Combine presets)	Zero-Shot (Reference Audio)	Zero-Shot (Reference Audio)
License	Apache 2.0	MIT	Apache 2.0 (Must use OpenF5 weights)
Speed	🚀 Blazing Fast	⚡ Fast	🐢 Slower (requires good GPU)
Commercial Use?	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes (verify "OpenF5" variant)
Recommendation
For a unique app voice: Use Kokoro and mix af_bella + af_sarah (or others) to create a custom "signature" voice. It's the fastest and safest route.

For cloning yourself: Use OpenVoice V2. It is the safest legal bet for commercial voice cloning right now without retraining a model from scratch.
